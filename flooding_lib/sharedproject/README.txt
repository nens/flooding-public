This is a subapp that holds code for use by national-wide projects
that use scenarios from other projects (ROR, "Landelijk gebruik").

There is code to determine which provincie a given waterschap delivers
data to, and views that generate Excel sheets per provincie. Hopefully
we can keep all the things related purely to those projects here, and
avoid cluttering the rest of flooding_lib too much.
