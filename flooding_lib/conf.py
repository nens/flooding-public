"""Use AppConf to store sensible defaults for settings. This also documents the
settings that lizard_damage defines. Each setting name automatically has
"FLOODING_LIB_" prepended to it.

By puttng the AppConf in this module and importing the Django settings
here, it is possible to import Django's settings with `from flooding_lib.conf
import settings` and be certain that the AppConf
stuff has also been loaded."""
